# great website probably

i'm just testing some stuff on my own.

## what i'm doing

- a little note app.
- my cv.

## what i'm using

- qwik (cool framework)
- express (cool node server)
- tailwind (cool class-based css framework)
- a bit of docker (because i don't understand it and want to)

## build locally

1. clone this
    ```
    git clone 
    ```
2. install all the dependencies
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. to run the dev server
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
4. to build and serve
    ```
    npm run build
    npm run deploy
    ```

## Express Server

This app has a minimal [Express server](https://expressjs.com/) implementation. After running a full build, you can preview the build using the command:

```
npm run serve
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
